# Examples

Each folder contains pairs of subunits. They folder `real_structures` contains the complete ones. In this document, they are classified according to its project.

## SBI Project

In `real_structures` there are two files that end with `_split`. They were created by this group, I think it has to do with the stoichiometries they used.

### Example 1

* Phosphate dehydratase (PDB ID: 2F1D)
* Stoichiometry: A8 according to group, A24 according to PDB

### Example 2

* ??
* Stoichiometry: A6B6.
	* There are two unique chains, build heterokmers Depending in the sto you give.
	* I think it doesn't work well with sto A7B7. 

### 1g65 SBI Project

* 20S proteasome (PDB ID: 1g65)
* Stoichiometry: A2B2C2D2E2F2G2H2I2J2K2L2M2N2
* [Link](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1g65)
* Notes:
	* Every chain is different
	* They used it with half the file (so all sto numbers are 1)
	* They introduced each time an increased sto (more letters) to check the scalability.
	* Pretty slow to execute.
	* Added twice because the pairs from the others could be different.

## SBI Proj 2

I think they used the folders ending with `all_interactions`, but I included both just in case.
